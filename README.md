# Bun vs. Deno Showdown

This is a silly little tool that I made for deciding which JavaScript runtime to use in our project at [Localify.org](https://localify.org).

*Gemini CLI & Claude 4.5 Sonnet were used to create and deploy this project. See [my stance on using Generative AI in my work](https://robog.net/docs/generative-ai-usage/).*
